# MISDc-v3.1-Hydrological-Model
The MISDc v3.1 model is a flexible, modular, semi-distributed conceptual hydrological model able to reproduce the hydrological variables that regulate the water cycle both in near-natural and anthropized basins. The model includes an irrigation module, a reservoir module, a water use module, a snow module, a soil module, and a routing module.
